    "\n",
    "VGG-16 is the name of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that was developed by the Oxford Visual Geometry Group (VGG). The model has 16 layers, hence the name VGG-16. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the model below, which is taken from the slides in class. The model below has 4 layers (convolution, pooling, convolution, pooling). VGG-16 is a similar concept, except VGG-16 has 16 layers instead of 4.\n",

    "VGG-16 became famous when it won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2014. The challenge is to see who can build the best image classifier for a very large set (1000 classes) of images. The model above classifies images into 10 classes (you can see the 10 output classes as red dots on the right side). Imagine having 1000 classes - that is what the VGG-16 was trained to do. Let's take a look at some example images from the ImageNet dataset. \n",

Not bad! (Actually, 7% error refers to the *top 5* error rate, which means that the correct label was in the top 5 model predictions). There are better models available now, but the prediction accuracy isn't much higher than that of the VGG-16. \n",
